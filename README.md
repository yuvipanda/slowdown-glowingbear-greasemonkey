# slowdown-glowingbear-greasemonkey
Greasemonkey script to help slow down and shape personal behavior on the Glowing Bear IRC Client

## What does it do? ##

After sending a message on IRC, it disables the input text box - preventing you
from typing - for a period of time (3s by default, should be more dynamic
in the future).

## WHY?! ##

Multitude of reasons:

1. I found that my IRC talking style was very scattered - multiple fragments
   said one after other, often not even forming a coherent sentence. While
   this does seem to communicate what I want most of the time, it is very
   unideal. It also seems to make it harder for me to write longer form text,
   which sucks!
2. IRC can get pretty heated sometimes! While I'm also working on other issues
   of emotional and mental control, aving some computer help is also nice!
   This forces me to stop and think before I can begin typing, helping stop
   words from flitting from my subconscious unfiltered onto IRC.
3. I talk too much on IRC! [These stats](http://korma.wmflabs.org/browser/irc-contributors.html)
   are pretty damn scary! Back when I used to use [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/),
   it would consistently show that I was spending about 30-50% of my on-computer
   time on IRC! This was personally unacceptable - I wanted to spend far less time
   talking :) I'm far more conscious of my IRC habits now than I was then, but
   every little bit helps :) If I can get away with reducing IRC time while
   still doing all the things I wanted to do, it'd be great!
 4. I have never written Greasemonkey scripts before, so it was a good way
    to learn!

 ## TODO ##

 1. Change the time interval of disabling based on time of day. This is to try
    encourage sleeping behavior I want to move to.
 2. Change the time interval based on the channel I am on. Some channels are
    more prone to flame wars and pointless chatter where two people violently
    agree with each other for hours on end. Identify these and help self-regulate
    behavior on those.
 3. Have a timer showing how long I've spent on IRC this day! Would be more
    helpful than the messages from RescueTime (which I no longer get) for being
    more accurate and realtime.
 4. More?!
